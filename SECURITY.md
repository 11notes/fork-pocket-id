# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As Pocket ID is in its early stages, older versions don't get security updates. Please consider to update Pocket ID regularly. Updates can be automated with e.g [Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for taking the time to report a vulnerability. Please DO NOT create an issue on GitHub because the vulnerability could get exploited. Instead please write an email to [elias@eliasschneider.com](mailto:elias@eliasschneider.com).
